# colors.nvim
This is a work-in-progress Neovim plugin to preview and edit colors, like in vscode!

# [Check out the Wiki](https://github.com/UnaTried/colors.nvim/wiki)

## It supports
- Realtime color highlighting
- Hex, rgb, hsl, CSS variables, and Tailwind CSS
- LSP that supports textDocument/documentColor like [tailwindcss](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-intellisense) and [csslsp](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-css-languageservice)
- Multiple modes: background, foreground, and symbol.

- The two modes foreground and background can't work be used at the same time for obvious reasons

There are some problems, but I would probably need some time to fix them.
